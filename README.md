A simple GUI controlled program for setting times to auto-kill other running programs.

This script was intended for use on Windows and has not been tested on other OSs.

The envisioned usecase was to set running times on streaming apps or browsers to auto-limit user screen time.

To use:
 - in the left panel select the apps you would like to set kill timers for.
 - below the left pane are two text input blocks (hours and minutes), set the amount of time before the apps are to be killed.
 - click the set button to add them to the kill list (list on the right).
 - if you hover over an item in the right block, a tooltip should show the remaining time.
 - if an item you want to set isn't showing on the left, click refresh to refresh the list.

An exe version of the script can be found in the dist folder.
